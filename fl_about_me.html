        Hello, my name is Fernando and I'm a high school junior. One thing to
        know about is that My favorite subjects in school is math and science
        because math has always come easy to me and with science it just has
        always been so interesting to me. Another thing to know about me is
        that my favorite color is blue which is why the background of this
        website is blue. Some of my favorite foods are pizza, burritos,
        chicken alfredo, and spaghetti.

      <p>These are some of my hobbies:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running"><strong>Running:</strong></a> This is a hobby I picked up
          during
          this summer and I can say that I can run for about 1 hour straight which I'm pretty proud of. I like to run
          around
          my basement in my freetime or when I need to let some stress out due to classes.

        <li>
          <a href="https://deadbydaylight.com/"><strong>Playing a video game called "Dead by Daylight":</strong></a>
          I've
          been playing this game since late 2017 and I've personally have had a blast. It's basically an
          asymmetrical 'horror' game where you try to escape if your the survivor or try to stop the
          survivors from escaping by sacrificing them to the entity.
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycling"><strong>Cycling:</strong></a> I like to cycle around the park
          I live near during the summer and fall and got into it last year when I just really had the urge to ride my
          bike
          that had been in my gargage for 2 years priot up to that moment
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="https://www.adobe.com/uk/creativecloud/illustration/discover/digital-art.html"><strong>Digital
              Art:</strong></a> I like to draw planets as I like space and they're quite easy to draw in my opinion, but
          other
          than that, I can't draw anything else really.
