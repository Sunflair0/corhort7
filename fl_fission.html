      <p>
        <strong>Nuclear Fission</strong> is a process in which a heavy
        atom, that is typically uranium in current nuclear power plants,
        is split into smaller atoms which release a large amount of energy.
        This process is dangerous if people don't wear the right equipment
        as uranium is radioactive and when it's split, the products the
        reaction has are also radioactive.

      <h1><strong>Nuclear Fission isn't Infinite</strong></h1>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        Unlike <a href="fl_website_project.html"><strong>Nuclear Fusion,</strong></a>
        Nuclear Fission is not green energy and not infinite as the element used
        in nuclear power plants is uranium and it isn't renwable as it would take
        thousands to millions of years for uranium to resupply. That doesn't mean
        that we shouldn't use nuclear fission or that it's unsafe, however.

      <h1><strong>Safety of Nuclear Fission</strong></h1>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>There is a misconception that <strong>Nuclear Fission</strong> is unsafe and
        something that is commonly referenced is the Chernobyl diaster in Ukraine in 1986,
        with Chernobyl still uninhabitable. Though since then, the advancements and knowledge in
        nuclear fission have increased with more safety measures with rigorous protocols with the automatic shutdown of
        nuclear reactors if something were to go wrong as an example,
        all to ensure safety. While you may still feel uneasy about nuclear power, know that now
        the probability of a nuclear diaster in general is 10<sup>-9</sup> to 10<sup>-10</sup>
        per year which practically means that a nuclear diaster is not plausible.
