            Nuclear fusion is basically hydrogen atoms fusing together to
            produce a heavier atom and releasing massive amounts of energy
            as a byproduct. For fusion reactions to occur, they must first
            have the hydrogen isoptopes known as deuterium and tritium. Next,
            the isotopes must be in an environment where the pressure is
            extremely high and the isotopes are heated up exponentially to a
            plasma state. Finally, when those conditions are met, the isotopes
            collide in at very high speeds and fuse together, which would create
            a heavier atom, which would typically be helium, and create a bunch
            of energy. Fusion reactions are where <a href="fl_sun.html">stars like the sun</a>
            get their power.

            The difference between nuclear fusion and nuclear fission is that
            nuclear fusion is combining two light atoms which are typically
            hydrogen, to form a heavier atom, which releases energy. Nuclear
            fission on the other hand, is the splitting of a heavy atom,
            typically uranium into smaller fragments which release energy.
            Fission reactions are unsafer than fusion reactions as the process
            of splitting an atom is more dangerous than fusing one. Fission
            reactions also produce long-lived radioactive waste while fusion
            produces minimal long-lived radioactive waste, though fission waste
            can be disposed of safely just like fusion waste due technological
            advancements. While they both release energy, nuclear fission energy
            is not infinite unlike nuclear fusion energy, but both are clean means
            of energy and i go more into depth <a href="fl_fission.html"><strong>here</strong></a>.

        <h1><strong>Effects of Nuclear Fusion</strong></h1>
        <div class="ef_txt">
          <p>There are many effects of <strong>Nuclear Fusion</strong>, both
            positive and negative, but I'll start out with the positive and
            those <strong>Positive Effects</strong> include:
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Abundant Fuel Supply:</strong> Fusion relies on the
              atom hydrogen and its isotopes, which are quite abundant due
              to it being the simplest element in the universe with only
              <strong>1</strong> proton and electron.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Clean Energy Production:</strong> Fusion produces energy
              without emitting greenhouse gases or long-lived radioactive waste,
              making fusion a clean energy source.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Safety:</strong> Fusion reactions are safer than fission
              reactions as said ealier, with no risk of runaway chain reaction
              or a large-scale nuclear meltdown.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Low Radioactive Waste:</strong> Fusion reactions generate
              minimal long-lived radioactive waste compared to fission which
              simplifies its disposal and reduces its environmental impact
            </li>
          </ul>
          Now that we've gone over the postive effects of nuclear fusion let's
          go over the <strong>Negative Effects</strong> which include:
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Technical Challeges:</strong> Achieving and maintaining the
              extreme conditions needed for sustained fusion reactions is a challenge
              as we've only been able to recreate fusion reactions for a short amount
              of time and need more advanced materials.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>High Cost:</strong> Building and maintaining the specilized
              infrastructure is very expensive as is the cost to researching nuclear
              fusion.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Energy Input VS. Output:</strong> Most fusion experiments lead
              to more energy being inputted than being output, there were however, two
              experiments which led to a net positive result though more research is needed
              to learn how to get that result more often and maintained.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Timeline To Make Marketable:</strong> The timeline for achieving a
              commercially viable fusion energy is unknown due to the many experiments
              still needed to learn how to produce a fusion reaction more frequently and
              maintain it.

            </li>
          </ul>
          Overall, the effects of <strong>Nuclear Fusion</strong> are positve and has no
          real negatives, just the questions of how and when we are going to achieve
          nuclear fusion energy.

        <h1><strong>Why I Think Nuclear Fusion is Cool</strong></h1>
        <div class="me_txt">

          <p>
            The reason I think Nuclear Fusion is cool is because infinite energy could help so
            many people as not everyone has access to reliable energy. Another reason I think
            nuclear fusion is cool is because it could potentially be used for long distance
            space travel and I really like outer space. The final reason I think nuclear fusion
            is cool is because I just really like advancements in science and how those
            advancements could help change the world for the better.
