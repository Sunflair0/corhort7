        <h7>Book The Pioneers</h7>
        <p><br>The Pioneers by David McCullough
            is a book that traces the development
            of the first Ohio settlement beginning
            in the 1780s through to the mid-nineteenth
            century1. McCullough argues that the founding
            settlers of the Northwest Territory were
            motivated to spread the American ideals
            of religious freedom, opposition to slavery,
            and advancement of education westward.
