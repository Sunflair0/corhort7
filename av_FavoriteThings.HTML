    <p>
        I started developing a love for reading books in my 7th grade year. Which is surprising because, at a very young
        age I never did like reading. I especially took a liking to Manga books.
        They brought me entertainment to me at my young age. I also took a liking to Mystery, Crime, and Romance books.

    <h3>Coffee</h3>

    <p>
        Coffee is my favorite drink out everything there is to drink. I've become obsessed with drinking coffee I drink
        it every morning, when I come back from school and every night.
        I prefer homemade coffee instead of buying it from a cafe.

    <h3>Drawing</h3>

    <p>
        I enjoy drawing when I have free time. I always been a creative girl at a young age. I enjoy drawing more anime,
        cartoons and characters from shows. I've never been a big fan of
        drawing more realistic pictures. I also prefer more my drawings to be black and white. Mainly because, I was
        never good at blending and matching colors well.
