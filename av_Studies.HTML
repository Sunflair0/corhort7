    <h1>My Education</h1>
    <p>Education I went through</p>
    <h3>Elementary School</h3>

    <p>
        My very first school I ever went to. Like any other kid I was scared to go to school without my parents. In my
        child mind it was really a big shift
        of environment for me. But in all it was the very first place I made friends. I can certainly say I was
        different from my Elementary years to my High
        School years. I was able to communicate more freely, which probably was because, I was a child. It was also the
        place where I found my love for art and
        also math. Which is a shocker because, kids usually don't like math or any subject except P.E. This was where
        the beginning of my adventure through my
        education started.

    <h3>Middle School</h3>

    <p>
        My Middle School years were really something. It was hard at the beginning because, I transferred to Marrs in my
        6th grade year. And
        Marrs is a middle school that starts with 5th grade. So obviously everyone had already known each other and had
        their own friend groups.
        Thankful, I managed to make friends and a have a good middle school year. In my 7th and 8th grade school years
        were when I started to get
        involved in sports. For both 7th and 8th I did volleyball and in my 7th grade year I did track and field. My
        specific field was the hurdles relay.
        It was a very fun experience through my middle school years.
    </p>

    <h3>High School</h3>

    <p>
        High School was a very different change and environment for me. I was very overwhelm when I first started high
        school. Especially
        when my Freshman year was taken virtually cause, of COVID-19. It was a struggle when we were able to start going
        physically to school cause, it
        was my first time in the school. My Sophomore and Junior years went smoothly thanks to my adjustment around the
        school. I was able to meet new
        friends and get to know about the people that are in my same grade. Currently, I'm in my Senior year, it is
        quite stressful because, you have to
        stay on top of stuff. Make sure you graduate, apply to college, and apply to scholarships. But in the end it
        will all be worth it for your future.

    <h3>College</h3>

    <p>
        I plan to major in Computer Science when I get into college. I was accepted in the University of Nebraska-Omaha
        (UNO). I don't plan to join a sport
        because, I first want to get use to college life and also I will certainly be busy with homework. I can be
        certain I am going to struggle through my
        Freshman year of college. Everyone does at the beginning because, it is really a bigger difference than High
        School. I really hope that UNO can be a
        big help for my future. Hopefully my future professors can make a big impact to me and help me through my
        college experience. And hopefully they can
        also help me when I graduate college and continue with my life.
