    <p>What I enjoy to watch</p>
    <h3>Anime</h3>

    <p>
        I love to watch anime when ever I have free time. I started liking anime at the age of 14.
        It brings a vibrant sense of energy that animated shows and films impact. I like it also because,
        it offers a wide range of perspectives on life, culture, and everything else in between. It installs
        hope, every anime has a character dream they wish to achieve and they strive for it. It also brings
        a feeling of freedom.

    <h3>Marvel</h3>

    <p>
        I'm more of a Marvel fan than a DC. Marvel just brings a unique ability to unite. No matter who you are
        or where you are from, for every person in the world there is a character they can aspire to. Also because,
        of the character developing and the ability to make the audience connect with them.
    </p>
    <h3>Crime / Procedural Drama</h3>

    <p>
        I always had an attraction to crime and procedural dramas. My first show I watched of this genre was
        Criminal Minds. And then the next show I found myself interested was 9-1-1. I love crime dramas because,
        they excel at weaving suspense-laden storylines that keep viewers on the edge of their seats. And I like
        procedural
        dramas because, the lack of long-term storylines makes it easier for viewers to tune in for just one episode
        without feeling lost.
